## Introduction

## Webcasts "iCSD - Stuff That Matters"

This year we have started with a new webcast series for you, called "iCSD - Stuff That Matters" (thanks to Maurice Driessen for the great name). The idea is to organize webcasts dealing with topics which seem relevant for the community related with devonfw and OASP4j. Each session is planned for half an hour up to an hour with reserved time for Q&A. There, you will be able to ask anything related to the topic or iCSD in general.

We started with a highly attended first session the 27th of January 2017 by Angel Marin from Capgemini Spain (Valencia) about "Dealing with Complexity on the Front End". Angel took a look at one of our front-end options provided by devonfw: Devon4sencha. This framework is based on Sencha, a powerful Javascript framework for creating “very” rich web applications. He showed how it makes it easy to deal with usually complex user interface patterns and during the session he explored some of the tools it provides. There was time for Q&A and we´re happy people did not hesitate to ask anything that came to their mind.

A second session was held the 24th of February by Jonas Molina Ramirez from Capgemini Germnay (Frankfurt) about "Testing with OASP4j". During his his talk Jonas investigated the testing facilities currently provided by OASP4J and he showed those features which aid you with

- Focus on test logic instead of infrastructure
- Manage your test data
- Configure your tests

The edited video of this talk has been uploaded to Teamforge and [can be found in the Server section](https://coconet.capgemini.com/sf/frs/do/viewRelease/projects.apps2_devon/frs.videos.devon_server?_message=1488358284665). It will be included soon in the devonfw Catalog in the 360 learning platform.

The third episode, planned for end of March / beginning of April, will deal with the ins and outs of Cobigen, the code generator in devonfw.
The Webcasts are definitely meant to be open. So, as always, you are very welcome to propose certain topics and / or present a topic yourself.

## devonfw-on-docker
What if we could create, test and even implement distributed Devon applications inside of software containers? What if we could even know how our apps would run on a cloud server right from the moment we have try locally?

Those questions are currently finding their answers. The Devonfw Core Team is right now working on apply some fancy **Docker** features to Devon projects. Imagine having an already prepared to be _dockerized_ project, which can be containerized just by following few steps, or even by executing a script. How cool is that?

A next step from here would be the usage we could provide to our containers. Those could distributively run in a cloud, and even having some different replicas depending on where in the world they are being accessed from.
